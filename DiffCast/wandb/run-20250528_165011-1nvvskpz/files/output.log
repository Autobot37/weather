torch.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 36.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacity of 23.64 GiB of which 19.94 MiB is free. Process 492339 has 584.00 MiB memory in use. Process 564616 has 16.26 GiB memory in use. Including non-PyTorch memory, this process has 6.75 GiB memory in use. Of the allocated memory 6.19 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 108.45 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF=expandable_segments:True to avoid fragmentation.
